Definition Of Ready :

  The Definition of Ready is a set of agreements that lets everyone know when something is ready to begin
  e.g., when a user story is ready to be taken into a sprint, 
  or when all necessary conditions are right for a team to start a sprint.
  
  Example – Definition of Ready for a Sprint:
    - The Sprint Backlog is prioritized
    - The Spring Backlog contains all defects, User Stories and other work that the team is committing to
    - No hidden work
    - All team members have calculated their capacity for the Sprint
    - Fulltime on project = X hours per day
    - All User Stories meet Definition of Ready
    
  Example – Definition of Ready for a User Story:
    - The value of Story to the user is clearly indicated.
    - The acceptance criteria for Story have been clearly described.
    - User Story dependencies identified
    - User Story sized by Delivery Team
    - Scrum Team accepts User Experience artifacts
    - Performance criteria identified, where appropriate
    - Person who will accept the User Story is identified
    - The team knows how to demo the story.
    
    
    
Definition Of Done :

  The definition of done (DoD) is when all conditions, 
  or acceptance criteria, that a software product must satisfy are met and ready to be accepted 
  by a user, customer, team, or consuming system. 
  
  Example – Definition of Ready for a User Story:
    - Unit tests passed
    - Code reviewed
    - Acceptance criteria met
    - Functional tests passed
    - Non-Functional requirements met
    - Product Owner accepts the User Story
